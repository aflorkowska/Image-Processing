# :bar_chart: Image processing techniques
This repo contains explanation of some image processing techniques, that are usefull for example for data preprocessing before application of machine learning algorthims or neutral networks. If you find something unclear, please let me know. 

The list of described topics, not only in english (ENG), as well as in polish (PL).  
1. Image as matrix
2. Derivative and gradient.
3. Image filtering.
4. Fourier transformation.
5. Morphological operations
6. Histogram equalization and matching
7. Segmentation - thresholding, global and local region growing and Canny edge detector
8. Interpolation and transformation matrixes.
9. Medical data loading.
10. Features extraction.

# :file_folder: Dataset
I based on some images from the following datasets:
- Eduardo Farina, FelipeKitamura. (2022). UNIFESP X-ray Body Part Classifier Competition. Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/unifesp-x-ray-body-part-classifier. I used also converted images (DICOM - PNG) from  X-ray Body Part dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ibombonato/xray-body-images-in-png-unifesp-competion/data
- Prostate Cancer Imaging from the National Cancer Institute. Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/world-wide-covid-dataset/data
- RSNA STR Pulmonary Embolism Detection - Classify Pulmonary Embolism cases in chest CT scans. Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-str-pulmonary-embolism-detection


# :books: Recommendations
I encourage you to get familiar with the following books:
- "Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" by R.Szeliski (http://szeliski.org/Book/)
- "Digital Image Processing" by R. Gonzalez and R.Woods
- "Image Processing and Analysis" by T.Chan and J.Shen
