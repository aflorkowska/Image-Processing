# Image processing techniques
This repo contains explanation of some image processing techniques, that are usefull for example for data preprocessing before application of machine learning algorthims or neutral networks. If you find something not clear, please let me know. 

My proposition order of topics:
1. Image as matrix
2. Gradient and Laplacian
3. Filters: median, uniform and gaussian
4. Morphological operations
5. Histogram equalization and matching
6. Global and local region growing
7. Cany edge detector

# Dataset
I based on some images from the following dataset:
Eduardo Farina, FelipeKitamura. (2022). UNIFESP X-ray Body Part Classifier Competition. Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/unifesp-x-ray-body-part-classifier

I used converted images (DICOM - PNG) from this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ibombonato/xray-body-images-in-png-unifesp-competion/data

# Getting started
Please create python enviroment with the following libraries:
- numpy
- opencv
- matplotlib
